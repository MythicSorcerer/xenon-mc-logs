## Hello!
I have created this github repo to publicize all of my server logs. The logs have not been audited. 
This is created as proof of non-admin abuse. 

Logmanual is created for myself to keep track of the detailed usage of the shells scripts included.
the .log.gz files are encrypted versions of the logs auto-generated by my server.

When I run the unzipper, it decrypts all of them to readable, where you can find the readable logs.
If I forget to run unzipper you can dowload the .log.gz files and decrypt them yourself. Most computers can do this.

This repo is updated nightly, and will be automated by a chronjob soon.
